Here's the problem: We've got a dartboard, which is essentially a 10 by 10 table. This dartboard is divided into five rings, with each ring scoring from 1 to 5 points, from the outermost to the innermost ring. You're given a certain number of tests, and for each test, you'll be provided with the locations that the darts hit as input. Your task is to calculate the total score for each test and display it as the output.
